1. Currently these scripts are only here for documentation, however with some modifications they could easily used in other projects and systems.
2. In order to run the script you should make sure all aux files are filled correctly, and are in the same filder as the grand scripts.
3. In addition you should make sure all packages are available to use in your system and direct the script to their path.

4. All samples could be analyzed using Grand_script_part1.sh and Grand_script_part2.sh - and they should be run sequentially.
The last script - Grand_script3.sh is specific for every experiment you want to analyze, and as such also the aux files used with the script.
